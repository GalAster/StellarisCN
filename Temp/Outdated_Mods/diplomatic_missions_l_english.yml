 ### Events
 diplomatic_missions.1.name:0 "War by Other Means"
 diplomatic_missions.1.desc:0 "The holographic pen is mightier than the tachyon lance, or so goes the old saying. It's time to put these words to the test.\n\nA young but capable group of diplomats has been selected among the best of our people. By sending them to the capitals of our Subject Empires, we may be able to negotiate the end of atrocities, give them special military status or even take extreme measures and make some demands - although our diplomats advise against it.\n\nCurrently, our diplomatic team is in our capital being prepared for their first diplomatic mission. They should be ready in about a week. Meanwhile, a special ship to transport our diplomats is being constructed."
 diplomatic_missions.2.name:0 "Diplomatic Ship"
 diplomatic_missions.2.desc:0 "After a week of preparations, our diplomatic team is ready to do some talking - and just in time. A special ship was built for them - a custom corvette, faster and more resistant, but with low firepower.\n\nWe should send the so called Diplomatic Ship to the capital system of one of our subjects as fast as possible."
 diplomatic_missions.3.title:0 "Diplomatic Program Terminated"
 diplomatic_missions.3.desc:0 "Our diplomatic program has been terminated. Sad, our diplomats return home with the hope that their words have not been said in vain.\n\nWithout a diplomatic team, there's no more need to maintain the Diplomatic Ship. It has been disassembled and it's personnel reallocated."
 diplomatic_missions.11.name:0 "Diplomatic Mission Begins"
 diplomatic_missions.11.desc.default:0 "Our diplomatic team was well received by the [DiplomaticTarget.GetAdj]. After a week introductions and cordialities, it's finally time to decide what they should do on the [DiplomaticTarget.GetName]."
 diplomatic_missions.11.desc.tsubject:0 "Our diplomatic team has safely arrived on [DiplomaticTarget.GetName]. The [DiplomaticTarget.GetAdj] was painfully cold. They were carefull enough to treat our diplomats well, but it's clear that our presence is only tolerated because they are our subjects.\n\nSuch animosity has a reason: taxes. The [DiplomaticTarget.GetName] is not happy about our current taxation policy and won't accept any diplomatic collaboration - or demands - while this matter remains unaddressed."

 diplomatic_missions.101.name:0 "Diplomats Recalled"
 diplomatic_missions.101.desc:0 "The sudden recall of our diplomats has left everyone with a bad taste in the mouth - including our own diplomats. We probably should have left the holographic pens home and brought the tachyon lances instead."

 diplomatic_missions.102.name:0 "[DiplomaticTareget.GetName] Reacts to Our Demands"
 diplomatic_missions.102.desc:0 "Today, might makes right. Fortunately, tomorrow the [DiplomaticTarget.GetName] may be the mighty ones. When that day arrives, we will not forget what has trespassed here."

 diplomatic_missions.110.name:0 "Inspection Results"
 diplomatic_missions.110.desc.slaver_purger:0 "Our diplomats' report has just came in. Things on the [DiplomaticTarget.GetName] are worse than we expected. They have no respect for sentient life, purging and enslaving as they see fit.\n\nNews of such atrocities were not well received by some of our citizens. We should act - but how?\n\nWe may be able to convince the [DiplomaticTarget.GetAdj] of the error of their ways, but this will require time, influence and resources. We can also demand the immediate end of atrocities, at the cost of our relationship with the [DiplomaticTarget.GetName]."
 diplomatic_missions.110.desc.slaver:0 "Our diplomats' report has just came in. Things on the [DiplomaticTarget.GetName] are worse than we expected.

 diplomatic_missions.1110.name:0 "The Price of Slavery"
 diplomatic_missions.1110.desc:0 "After months of negotiations, the [DiplomaticTarget.GetAdj] seems open to the idea of abolishing slavery. However, there's still one unresolved issue: the economical impact of such measure. Unless we somehow make up for their losses, negotiations will not proceed.\n\nAgainst his better judgment, our chief diplomat asked the [DiplomaticTarget.GetAdj] to put a price on the head of each slave. Ironically, the fact that they value life so little is a good thing for us: we can buy the freedom of these poor beings for 10 minerals and 5 Energy Credits each."
 diplomatic_missions.1110.a:0 "Dignity is worth any price."
 diplomatic_missions.1110.b:0 "What an outrageous idea! Recall our diplomats!"
 diplomatic_missions.1111.name:0 "Purging Problems"
 diplomatic_missions.1111.desc:0 "Purging, as atrocious as it is, has been a common solution to deal with agitators and criminals on the [DiplomaticTarget.GetName]. The [DiplomaticTarget.GetAdj] fears that they may lose control over their citizens.\n\nOne simple solution would be to fund their local armies. Efficient ground forces could deal any civil unrest easily."

 diplomatic_missions.200.name:0 "March: A True Battle Thrall"
 diplomatic_missions.200.desc:0 "Marches are a special kind of subject empire, with a military focus. They do not pay any kind of taxes, can colonize and have a bonus to military production.\n\nMarches are extremely loyal, but can be quite dangerous if they ever revolt."
 diplomatic_missions.200.a:0 "Turn [DiplomaticTarget.GetName] into a March."
 diplomatic_missions.200.z:0 "Thinking better..."
 diplomatic_missions.210.name:0 "[DiplomaticTarget.GetName]'s Answer"
 diplomatic_missions.210.desc.not_pacifist:0 "We graciously accept your offer! This day will mark a new era to the [ROOT.GetName] and [DiplomaticTarget.GetName]! The gaalxy soon fear our combined might!"
 diplomatic_missions.210.desc.pacifist:0 "We are sad to disappoint you, but such arrangement goes against everything we hold dear. We'll remain loyal to the [ROOT.GetName], but not as a weapon to be used to harm others."
 diplomatic_missions.210.a:0 "Excellent."
 diplomatic_missions.210.b:0 "That's disappointing."
 diplomatic_missions.220.name:0 "Stop Marching!"
 diplomatic_missions.220.desc:0 "Should we turn the [DiplomaticTarget.GetName] into a common Vassal? If we do this, they'll lose any privilegies they had as a March, including taxes exemption and diplomatic freedom. Understandably, they won't like it one bit."

 diplomatic_missions.301.desc:0 "We are happy to hear you are inclined to relax such an unjust policy. But, as happy as we may be, we have not lost our sense of reality. We are well aware that it's a temporary measure. We welcome it just the same, but have to ask: for how long will it last?"
 diplomatic_missions.301.a: "You are exempt for 10 years"
 diplomatic_missions.301.b: "You are exempt for 15 years"
 diplomatic_missions.301.c: "You are exempt for 30 years"
