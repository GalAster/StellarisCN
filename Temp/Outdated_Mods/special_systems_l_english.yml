 ## EVENT CHAIN

 special_systems_survey_count:0 "Number of stars surveyed"
 
 special_systems.00.name:0 "Probe Identified!"
 special_systems.00.desc:0 "A probe has been identified in orbit around §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, it is badly damaged and no longer operational. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested that we should try to access it's mainframe before it completely disintegrates."
 
 special_systems.01.name:0 "Probe"
 special_systems.01.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was successful in accessing the probe's mainframe, it has taken some time to piece together the information and decipher it.From what [Root.GetLeaderName] has gathered so far, this probe was created to monitor certain systems but it malfunctioned while traveling between them and has been gradually disintegrating for some time. [Root.GetLeaderName] managed to transfer most of the information before the close proximity of §H[Root.GetName]§! caused the Probe to break apart. Some damage was sustained but no one was seriously injured. [Root.GetLeaderName] suggests that we identify these systems and determine why they were being monitored."
 
 special_systems.02.name:0 "§Y[From.GetStarName]§!"

 special_systems.05.name:0 "§Y[From.From.GetName]§!"
 special_systems.05.desc:0 "A survey of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has revealed that the intense gravity generated by this type of star will greatly reduce any ship's interstellar capabilities and cause structural damage over time. Smaller ships will suffer greatly in these sytems. Strange distortions in the space time continuum were observed being randomly generated by opposing gravitational forces, this will cause some areas of space to experience time at a much slower rate."
 special_systems.06.name:0 "§Y[From.From.GetName]§!"
 special_systems.06.desc:0 "A survey of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has revealed that these systems are home to Cloud Entities that freely pass between dimensions, they appear to thrive on energy produced by this type of star and generate a strange by-product that makes solid matter far heavier while exposed and will greatly increase any ship's structural integrity but also decrease their ability to project shields. While it doesn't appear that the entities are hostile we should be cautious as they may see our ships as sources of energy."
 special_systems.07.name:0 "§Y[From.From.GetName]§!"
 special_systems.07.desc:0 "A survey of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has revealed that this type of star intermittently generates incredibly strong bursts of very high frequency sound that shifts solid mass at random and will greatly reduce any affected ship's structural integrity but also increase the density and recharge rate of shields. While the high frequency sound cannot be actively heard, prolonged exposure will cause irritation and anger."
