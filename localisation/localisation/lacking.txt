It is identical to the one that was produced by the Chrysanthemum's engines. It must have originated from the Hyacinth!\n\nAlthough the faint ion trail is over a century old, we have been able to track it on an outbound trajectory towards a previously uncharted star. We have entered its coordinates into the Situation Log."
