 tfw_crisis.1130.desc:1 "Our scanners are reporting about a strange gravitational anomaly that has suddenly appeared in [extradimensional_system.GetName] system! This is a subspace tear acting like a one-way portal with a strong emission of uncommon particles.\n\nBut there is something else. We are receiving reports about a strange space structure appeared in this system and incoming fleets of strange vessels with an obscure design! Last reports contain some information about their aggressive behavior. All attempts to establish contact with them were failed. This may be a serious threat for our Galaxy."
 tfw_crisis.1140.name:0 "A big gravitational anomaly"
 tfw_crisis.1140.desc:0 "Our deep space scanners across the [Root.GetName] have detected powerful gravitational fluctuations with a strong particle emission in our Galaxy. We are trying to collect more data to explain their nature."

 tfw_crisis.1141.name:0 "The extradimensional portal"
 tfw_crisis.1141.desc:0 "Finally our researches have come to an end. Those gravitational fluctuations are focused in some kind of extradimensional portal in [extradimensional_system.GetName] system. But there is something else. We are receiving reports about a strange space structure appeared in this system and incoming fleets of strange vessels with an obscure design! Last reports contain some information about their aggressive behavior. All attempts to establish contact with them were failed. This may be a serious threat for our Galaxy."

 tfw_crisis.1121.name:0 "The portal has closed"
 tfw_crisis.1121.desc:0 "Our scanners show that this extradimensional anomaly in [extradimensional_system.GetName] system has disappeared. However, we are receiving messages about those strange fleets terrorizing vicinities of [extradimensional_system.GetName]. But there is something else. We have detected a large amount of those extradimensional particles emissed from the portal, was caught by the magnetic field of [exd_rndm_planet.GetName]. We should gather them and manage some researches as soon as we can."
 tfw_crisis.1121.a:0 "This ain't gonna be easy."
 
 tfw_crisis.1230.name:1 "The Second Portal"
 tfw_crisis.1230.desc:1 "We are receiving information about another gravitational anomaly in [second_extradimensional_system.GetName]! The second portal has appeared in this system and the second extradimensional base with hostile fleets are incoming right now. This may be their reinforcements. Looks like this is a serious invasion. We called this creatures "Extradimensional Hunters"."
 tfw_crisis.1230.a:0 "This is a test of our faith..."
 tfw_crisis.1230.b:0 "We will show no mercy."
 tfw_crisis.1230.c:0 "This will grant us a guaranteed science breakthrough."

 tfw_crisis.1330.b:0 "We will teach them some good manners."
 tfw_crisis.1330.c:0 "Maybe we should build more science ships..."
 tfw_crisis.1330.d:0 "It seems like there are no peaceful ways to resolve this..."
 tfw_crisis.1330.e:0 "Hope we won't damage their wrecks too hard."
 tfw_crisis.1330.f:0 "We won't give up."

 tfw_crisis.1622.name:0 "The third extradimensional base was destroyed!"
 tfw_crisis.1622.desc:0 "Now we are not intercepting any signals of the third extradimensional outpost. [From.From.GetName] is reporting about its successful military operation in this sector of the Galaxy."

 tfw_crisis.1700.b:0 "这是种族灭绝！"
 
 tfw_crisis.1800.name:0 "Altions"
 tfw_crisis.1800.desc:0 "We have successfully gathered extradimensional particles from [exd_rndm_planet.GetName]'s magnetosphere. Our scientists called them "altions". Altions are massive extra high-energy particles with a peculiar structure, so they can't be gained in our standart mass accelerators. Futhermore, a new type of interparticle interactions prevents their fast decay. Despite of all this "miracles" now we can start our work on a special altion emitter that will be able to generate this particles."
 tfw_crisis.1800.a:0 "杰出的！"
 
 tfw_crisis.1810.name:0 "错过的机会"
 tfw_crisis.1810.desc:0 "Our last observations of [extradimensional_system.GetName] system showed us that all extradimensional particles have decayed in [exd_rndm_planet.GetName]'s magnetosphere. We have lost our chance to research them."
 tfw_crisis.1810.a:0 "这是不幸的。"
